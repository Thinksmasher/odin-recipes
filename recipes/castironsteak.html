    <p><em>This simple method makes cooking steak easier than ever!</em></p>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>
        We tend to assume steak has to be done on a flame grill or it's not real steak. Well,
        that's not true! The key to a great steak is cooking at a very high heat that will
        properly sear the outside of the cut. A cast iron grill is perfect for that! Now
        you can enjoy steak at any time year, without the intimidation factor of a flame
        grill!

    <h4>Indredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak (New York Strip or Rybeye)</li>
        <li>3 tsp kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove steak from refrigerator and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons salt; let stand 45-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until extremely hot, 4-5 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1 teaspoon salt in bottom of skillet; pat beef dry with paper towels. Place steak in skillet and cook until easily moved, 1-2 minutes; flip, placing steak in a different section of the skillet. Cook 30 seconds and then begin moving steak, occasionally pressing slightly to ensure even contact with skillet.</li>
        <li>Add butter and rosemary to skillet, frequently basting the steak in the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Continue turning and flipping until cooked to desired degree of doneness (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°; medium, 140°; medium-well, 145°), 1-2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
