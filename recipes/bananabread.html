    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Banana bread is a simple baked good, but often it can be dry and lack flavour. Our recipe changes
        that up with some simple tweaks that will take your banana bread to a whole new level! The key
        differences here are using more bananas, and using overripe bananas. You'll want 5 to 6 bananas 
        that are turning brown, then store them in the freezer until you're ready to bake. When the peel 
        is dark brown all over, they are ready for baking! This also means the flesh inside will be gooey
        and easier work with.
